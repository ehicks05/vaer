Notes on how to get icons:

1. Using https://favicon.io/, you can either:
   1. create a letter-based favicon, choosing colors, fonts, and sizes
   2. convert an existing image

Either way, you should end up with a handful of files.

3. Use https://maskable.app/editor to resize one of the images to be maskable.
